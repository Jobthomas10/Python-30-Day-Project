# Day 4: Typecasting

## Overview
Todayâ€™s task is to practice **typecasting** in Python. Typecasting is converting one data type to another, which is useful when you need to work with different types together in the same code.

## Task

1. **Convert an Integer to a String:**
   - Create a variable called `age` and set it to your age as an integer.
   - Convert `age` to a string and print: `"I am X years old!"`, replacing `X` with your age.
   - *Hint:* Use `str()` to convert to a string.

2. **Convert a String to a Float:**
   - Create a variable `height_str` and set it to your height in inches as a string, e.g., `"67.5"`.
   - Convert `height_str` to a float and print it.
   - *Hint:* Use `float()` for the conversion.

3. **Convert a Float to an Integer:**
   - Create a variable `price` with a decimal value, e.g., `19.99`.
   - Convert `price` to an integer (dropping the decimal) and print it.
   - *Hint:* Use `int()` to cast to an integer.

## Summary
This task helps you understand how to change data types in Python, which is important for handling data more flexibly.
