# Day 1

## **Task**: Understand and use variables in Python.

**Description**:
A variable is a container for storing data values. In Python, variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

**Example**:
```python
# Declare a variable
full_name = "Joe George"
age = "18"
is_student = True

print(f"Hello {full_name}!")
print(f"Your name is {full_name} and you are {age} years old.")
print(f"Are you a student? Ans: {is_student}")

if is_student:
    print("He is a student")
else:
    print("He is not a student")
