# Day 15: Functions and Looping with Dictionaries

## **Task**: Explore functions that operate on dictionaries and practice looping through dictionaries to manipulate and retrieve data.

**Description**:  
In Python, functions can be defined to perform operations on dictionaries, making your code more modular and reusable. Additionally, understanding how to loop through dictionaries is crucial for processing data efficiently. Todayâ€™s task will focus on:

1. **Defining functions** that take dictionaries as arguments.
2. **Using loops** to iterate over keys, values, and key-value pairs in dictionaries.
3. Implementing beginner-friendly questions to reinforce your understanding.

##  1. Defining a Function to Calculate Average Scores
Create a function that takes a dictionary of student scores and returns the average score.

```python
def average(i):
    total = sum(i.values())        # Here the total value is set as the sum of all values
    count = len(i)                 # Here the total count is set to the number of values
    average = total/count          # Avg = total/count
    return average

print("Average Score:",average(student_scores))        # The function average() is used to find the average score.
```

## 2. Function to Find the Highest Score
Define a function that finds the student with the highest score.

```python
def find_highest_score(scores):
    highest_student = None
    highest_score = 0
    for student, score in scores.items():
        if score > highest_score:
            highest_score = score
            highest_student = student
    return highest_student, highest_score

highest_student, highest_score = find_highest_score(student_scores)
print(f"Highest Score: {highest_student} with {highest_score}")
```

3. Looping Through Keys and Values
Use a loop to print each student's name along with their score.

```python
for student in student_scores:
    print(f"{student}: {student_scores[student]}")
```

4. Looping Through Key-Value Pairs
You can also loop through key-value pairs directly using the items() method.

```python
for student, score in student_scores.items():
    print(f"{student} has a score of {score}.")
```
